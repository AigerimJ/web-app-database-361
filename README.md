# web-app-database-361

#Task:

- Create a simple web application that connects to a database and performs some elementary operations.

- The application can consist of a simple servlet or JAX-RS service.

- By navigating to particular URLs the application should:
    Create a unique table (per application, make sure the table name includes your surname);
    Add data into the table (INSERT query);
    Display data in the database (SELECT query).
    
- You can use the external MySQL instance, or you can connect to a local database if you have installed one already.
